// Netlink is not a great protocol for *knowing* things. The protocol
// design makes it impossible to track changes precisely. You can see
// this by looking at things like Quagga or Bird, which all include
// keeping a local impression of what they think is in the kernel, and
// periodically doing a full state dump to find errors. They do use
// events, but explicitly only as an optimization, because they can't
// be trusted.
//
// Fortunately, we don't really need to know what exactly changed. We
// just want to know that network conditions may have changed, and we
// should re-explore connectivity. This is why we subscribe to events,
// and then blindly fire our callback without looking at the content
// of the notifications.
